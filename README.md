**Experience Notation** is a structured language for modelling user journeys, decisions, personas, and interactions in a readable and simulation-ready format. It is designed for LLM prompting, human authoring, and machine parsing. Originally developed as part of the [Demoscope.ai](https://demoscope.ai) platform ‚Äî a commercial service for synthetic user feedback ‚Äî it is now available as an open-source specification.

## Key Concepts

Experience Notation is:

* **Readable** ‚Äî Uses indentation and labels to keep files accessible.
* **Structured** ‚Äî Validates via both EBNF and JSON Schema.
* **Expressive** ‚Äî Captures emotional context, UI interaction, branching.
* **Modular** ‚Äî Supports external references and journey composition.
* **LLM-compatible** ‚Äî Can be generated, simulated, and adapted through prompts.

## In Use

Experience Notation powers [Demoscope.ai](https://demoscope.ai), a commercial platform for synthetic user feedback and behavioural simulation. `.expn` files are used to structure multi-step journeys and guide persona interactions in production environments.

---

## Grammar & Schema

* [EBNF Syntax](./spec/Experience-Notation.ebnf)
* [JSON Schema](./spec/experience-notation.schema.json)

You can validate `.expn` files using:

* `$schema` field in supported editors
* `ajv-cli` for JSON structure validation
* Experimental tools (see roadmap)

---

## Roadmap

* [ ] Bidirectional JSON ‚Üî `.expn` parser
* [ ] EBNF validation and linting tool
* [ ] Web-based editor / playground
* [ ] SDKs and developer tools
