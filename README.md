# Experience Notation (.xnote)

**Experience Notation** is a structured language for modelling user journeys, decisions, personas, and interactions in a readable and simulation-ready format. It is designed for LLM prompting, human authoring, and machine parsing. Originally developed as part of the [Demoscope.ai](https://demoscope.ai) platform â€” a commercial service for synthetic user feedback â€” it is now available as an open-source specification.

## Key Concepts

Experience Notation is:

* **Readable** â€” Uses indentation and labels to keep files accessible.
* **Structured** â€” Validates via both EBNF and JSON Schema.
* **Expressive** â€” Captures emotional context, UI interaction, branching.
* **Modular** â€” Supports external references and journey composition.
* **LLM-compatible** â€” Can be generated, simulated, and adapted through prompts.

## Example

```xnote
Journey: simple-onboarding
Title: Simple Onboarding Journey
Personas:
  Persona A: New User
    Traits: { tech_savvy=false }
    Experience: Curious and slightly anxious
Events:
  Event 1: App Launch
    Step 1:
      User: Persona A
      Action: Opens the mobile app
      UI-Element: Splash screen
      Tag: entry
  Event 2: Sign-Up
    Step 1:
      User: Persona A
      Action: Enters email and password
      UI-Element: Registration form
    Step 2:
      User: Persona A
      Action: Taps "Create Account"
      UI-Element: Call-to-action button
      Tag: confirmation
```

## In Practice

Experience Notation powers [Demoscope.ai](https://demoscope.ai), a commercial platform for synthetic user feedback and behaviour simulation. `.xnote` files are used to structure multi-step journeys and guide persona interactions in production environments.

---

## Schema & Grammar

* [EBNF Syntax](./spec/Experience-Notation.ebnf)
* [JSON Schema](./spec/experience-notation.schema.json)

You can validate `.xnote` files using:

* `$schema` field in supported editors
* `ajv-cli` for JSON structure validation
* Experimental tools (see roadmap)
